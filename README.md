# pyaction
This code solves a simple 1D linear elasticity equation on a finite element mesh, with the beam subjected to a linearly increasing traction load from left to right, given by the expression -x[0]. The beam is fixed at the left end and subjected to a unit displacement at the right end. The solution is then plotted and saved as an image file named beam_mech.png.
